  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>We’re a Dutch startup smart clothing startup called ADAM & AOKI.</p>

    <p>So what do we mean by smart clothing? In short, we want to start making clothes that help people overcome everyday challenges. We feel that after thousands of years of practicality, it’s time for clothes to become as smart as we are.</p>

    <p>We plan to launch our first product in June via kickstarter. Our concept is a kids t-shirt that changes colour and warns users that they are in risk of getting sunburnt. The smart fabric in the t-shirt detects the presence dangerous UV light (the stuff that gives you sunburn) and will warn children and parents via a colour change in the sleeve. Our smart t-shirts also takes into account both your skin type and the time it takes you to burn.</p>

    <p>The first line of products won’t involve wearable tech. Whilst we do envisage that it will become part of our products in the future we feel that affordable technology at present isn’t advanced enough for it to be practical and durable enough for kids.</p>
